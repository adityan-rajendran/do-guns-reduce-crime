# do-guns-reduce-crime
This project aims at determining if Gun laws reduce crime in the US.

There exists an ever-lasting argument whether public can be allowed to carry a gun or not. There are high chances that the person who has gun license bought for his protection may misuse it. Other set of argument goes along, if everyone has a gun, criminals would be afraid to get near the victim. In this dataset there are a total of 13 columns which falls under the category of panel data and in which there are 3 columns which determine the crimes â€“ robbery, violent and murder rate.

Based on the observation made for 23 years on various parameters on the population on how states had laws whether its legal to carry a gun or not, we are going to determine whether having gun laws have reduced the crime rate or not.

A complete exploratory data analysis followed by rigorous modelling procesures is performed to finally determine if gun laws does reduce crime or not.
